Each file 'digit?.mat' contains the training set of the particular
digit. When you load the file into Matlab you get one variable D with
size n x m , where n varies (it's of the order of thousands) and
m=28*28=784. 

Note that if you want to follow the notation of the assigment paper
transpose of D should be used; in Matlab: 
	  
	  D=D'; 

Now every column in D is one single image presented as a vector. To
visualize them as 2D images use the Matlab reshape function. Thus, to
extract the 10th image from the matrix presenting digit '4' use the
commands

	load digit4.mat;
	D=D';
	mi=28;
	im=reshape(D(:,10),mi,mi);
	imagesc(im);
